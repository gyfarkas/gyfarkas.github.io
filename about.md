I'm a developer working for a financial information and data
company. I work with the Microsoft stack (C#, SQL Server). I wrote a
LINQ provider for the DAX data manipulation language. 

My main hobby is Maths, from foundations, category theory to
statistics and machine learning. As a consequence I really enjoy
learning new programming languages and math inspired algorithms and
data structures. My favourites are: Haskell, Scala, Idris, Julia, but
I use C#/F#, python and R often for useful work.
